      <h2>Bio</h2>
        <span>I have been into computers since I first laid eyes on a video game. I continue to drive myself with that same passion into my work and love to make the enviroment im in more fun for all involed. Outside of work, I'm a father of 3 and an avid Gaming Enthusiast, always trying to cement my place on leaderboards. My goal with programing has and always will be to make things better while keeping things fun for everyone involed.

        <div class="column"><h3>Project 1</h3><img src="images/controller6.png" class="project" alt="project one">
          <br><span class="data">With project one my goal was to take something we are all use to that is usually boring and bring some fun into it! This way it attracts the users because its something they already use that is minimal with it's interface, but adds more character and appeal visually.<br>While programing project one, I used Atom, Gitbash, Github, and a few online tools to manipulate JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML.

        <div class="column"><h3>Project 2</h3><img src="images/controller6.png" class="project" alt="project one">
          <br><span class="data">They say "If it isn't broke, don't fix it.". Well thats just not my style, so here I took a common, mundane app, and turned it into a polished gem. As you can see it retains all the core functionality while adding some new features that I feel are key componets that no one knew they even needed until now.<br>With this app, we used Atom, Gitbash, github and various online tools, to manipulate JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML, but a key componet was the use of Canvas.
